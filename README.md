# Excel_Testing

Trying to control Excel using multiple Windows Forms.
Having trouble getting the second from to grab the created Excel Object from Form1.
I'm currently able to grab the first open Excel Application, which kind of works, it gets messed up when there's multiple instances of Excel Running.
Would like to be able to grab the exact instance increated in Form1.
